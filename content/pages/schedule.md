      * Reaper
      * Soundtrap 
   * Listen to the favorite songs we didn't get to on Tuesday

  **In class lab:**

   Take screenshots and label the important parts of your chosen DAW. Due by the end of today. 

   Include the following elements: 
   * Transport 
   * Transport time with real time, SMPTE, and musical time 
   * edit view - just edit view 
   * mix view - with edit view together 
      *  label these elements: volume fade, mute, solo, record enable, pan knob, input slot, output slot 

   If you know your group you can go up to the studio and start your recording project. Make sure to save your files to your OneDrive or external hard drive.

   If you need help using Ableton see the LinkedIn Learning Course [Ableton Live 10 Essential Training](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/ableton-live-10-essential-training/track-controls)
  
   **Thursday 9/16**

   * Mixing concepts – volume, pan, automation, dynamics, eq 


   Project 2: Create a sound scene 

   Take the edited recordings and create a short (00:30 – 1:00) etude using the mixing concepts we have learned. An etude is not meant to be a piece of music, so don’t worry about artistic merit. 

   <strong>Other possible assignments: </strong>volume and pan, compressor, equalization, time-based effects

Project 3: Drum Programming 
<p>
Create a 3 – 4-minute-long piece of beat music. Use Groove Pizza to create looped beats then import them into Ableton Live. Only use samples from project 1. You can edit these samples in any way to make appropriate sounds for percussion instruments. You may use any of the editing or mixing concepts we have learned so far. Use at least one effect and automate at least one parameter on that effect. 
<p>
As harmonic and melodic elements import a MIDI recording of a Bach piece. Download a bunch here: http://www.bachcentral.com/midiindex.html
