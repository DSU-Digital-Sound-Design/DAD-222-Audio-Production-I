<p>
Project 1: Starting the sample pack. 
<p>
Work in groups of two. One person “performs” while the other tracks. Pick one thing to record, an instrument or an object. Get at least 10 recordings of distinct sounds. 
<p>
Remove unwanted material from the beginning and ending of the recording. Cut sounds into separate files and name them appropriately. Apply fades to the start and end to avoid clicks. Raise the levels of the recordings so they are all similar.
<p>
Make sure 5 of the recordings can be edited later as a loop. Explore all the different sounds that the object can make. Use at least two different microphones and compare the results.

   <td>DAW continued – editing and mixing
<ul>

<li>Editing concepts – non-destructive editing, fades, crossfades, time and pitch shift 

<li>Mixing concepts – volume, pan, automation, dynamics, eq 

<p>
Project 2: Create a sound scene 
<p>
Take the edited recordings and create a short (00:30 – 1:00) etude using the mixing concepts we have learned. An etude is not meant to be a piece of music, so don’t worry about artistic merit. 
<p>
<strong>Other possible assignments: </strong>volume and pan, compressor, equalization, time-based effects

<p>
Project 3: Drum Programming 
<p>
Create a 3 – 4-minute-long piece of beat music. Use Groove Pizza to create looped beats then import them into Ableton Live. Only use samples from project 1. You can edit these samples in any way to make appropriate sounds for percussion instruments. You may use any of the editing or mixing concepts we have learned so far. Use at least one effect and automate at least one parameter on that effect. 
<p>
As harmonic and melodic elements import a MIDI recording of a Bach piece. Download a bunch here: http://www.bachcentral.com/midiindex.html
