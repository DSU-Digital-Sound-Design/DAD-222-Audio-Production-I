   ## The Digital Audio Workstation – recording and editing

   **Tuesday 9/7**

   * Listen to some of your favorite songs. 



   [Project 1 - Starting the sample pack](pages/projects) - Due: Tuesday 9/14

   **Thursday 9/9**

   * Look at the [studio webpage](https://sites.google.com/view/charmstudios/home) and booking system
   * [Common DAW functionality](pages/lectures/week-3/DAW) - [PDF](pages/lectures/week-3/DAW/daw.pdf) – play, stop, record, the  timeline
   * Comparing these different elements between DAWs
      * Ableton Live
      * Logic Pro
      * Reaper
      * Soundtrap 
   * Listen to the favorite songs we didn't get to on Tuesday

  **In class lab:**

   Take screenshots and label the important parts of your chosen DAW. Due by the end of today. 

   Include the following elements: 
   * Transport 
   * Transport time with real time, SMPTE, and musical time 
   * edit view - just edit view 
   * mix view - with edit view together 
      *  label these elements: volume fade, mute, solo, record enable, pan knob, input slot, output slot 

   If you know your group you can go up to the studio and start your recording project. Make sure to save your files to your OneDrive or external hard drive. 

   If you're done with the class, lab and you aren't recording, spend the rest of class exploring Ableton Live and see what you can make with it.

   * Editing concepts - non-destructive editing
      * Loop - command / control + L 
      * cut, copy, paste, trim
      * cut time, paste time, duplicate time, delete time
      * split - command / control + E
      * consolidate - command / control + J 
      * fades,  
      * crossfades, 
      * time - warping in Ableton Live

      * pitch shift 

   In class assignment [instructions](pages/lectures/week-4/editing-project-instructions)
  
   If you need help using Ableton see the LinkedIn Learning Course [Ableton Live 10 Essential Training](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/ableton-live-10-essential-training/track-controls)
  
   **Thursday 9/16**

   * Mixing concepts – volume, pan, automation, dynamics, eq 

   Mixing Lab: Create a mix from one of the example projects [here](https://www.cambridge-mt.com/ms/mtk-newbies/) in the entry level projects section. Use volume, pan, automation, dynamics processing and equalization. 

   * Start with setting the volumes of each track. Set all of the volumes to -60, then bring in each track one by one, in order of importance. Then, pan elements that are important to the center, and elements that are less important away from the center to create more width. 
   * Add automation to at least one track. This can be done easily to volume to create interest in the mix.
   * Add dynamics processing using a compressor to at least two tracks. Try the vocal track. 
   * Add equalization to at least two tracks. 

   Submit your final mix as well as your project file. 

   Due Tuesday 9/21

   ## MIDI editing and Sampling 

   **Tuesday 10/12**

   * [MIDI editing and quantization](pages/lectures/week-8/midi-editing.md)

   **Thursday 10/14**

   *  Intro to sampling 
      * Simpler  

   Project 3 Due Tuesday 10/19: Drum Programming and Sampling 

   Create a 3 - 4 minute composition that uses MIDI to play a drum kit and sampling techniques to create a melody from the recordings you made in class. Use a drum rack for the drum kit and a simpler or sampler for the melody. Your drum track must not be a repeating loop and must entirely be programmed by yourself. Use the simpler in 3 different modes: classic, one-shot and slice. One-shot mode will be used with the drums. Classic can be used to play parts of longer samples and slice can play short rhythmic bits of longer samples. 

   Requirements:
   * 10 pts - drum rack - can use a preset kit, this will use many simpler instruments in one-shot mode 
   * 10 pts - One simpler instrument in classic mode
   * 10 pts - one simpler instrument in slice mode  
   * 10 pts - Composition only uses MIDI to triggers samples; no audio loops are used 



   <!-- Create a 3 – 4-minute-long piece of beat music. Use Groove Pizza to create looped beats then import them into Ableton Live. Only use samples from project 1. You can edit these samples in any way to make appropriate sounds for percussion instruments. You may use any of the editing or mixing concepts we have learned so far. Use at least one effect and automate at least one parameter on that effect. 

   As harmonic and melodic elements import a MIDI recording of a Bach piece. Download a bunch here: http://www.bachcentral.com/midiindex.html -->
