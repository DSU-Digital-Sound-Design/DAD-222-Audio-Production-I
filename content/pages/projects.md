## Project 1 - Starting the sample pack. 


Work in groups of 2-4 in the recording studio. One person “performs” while the other tracks, and anyone left over watches how to track. Pick one thing to record, an instrument or an object. 

Make at least 10 recordings. These will be used to build your own personal sample pack. Decide if you want these to be "musical" or "sound effects" recordings. If you decide to record something more musical, be sure to note the tempo and key of whatever you record, so that you can compose something more easily in the editing process. 

If you're going the sound effects route and recording an instrument, don't just record 10 different tones. Try to get a variety of timbres. Try extended techniques. Experiment with placing the microphone different distances from the audio source. Also experiment with recording very quiet sounds, or very loud sounds. 

Make sure 5 of the recordings can be edited later as a loop. Explore all the different sounds that the object can make. Use at least two different microphones and compare the results.

Along with your recordings, be sure to turn in a list of what microphones you used for each recording, with a description of microphone placement.

## Project 2

Create a 3 - 4 minute composition out of your sample pack recordings. If you recorded musical sounds your composition might sound more traditionally music. If you recorded sound effects it will sound more like a sound scene or a piece of electroacoustic music. Either is good. Make use of the mixing concepts we've learned in class. 

A successful project will include: 
* 5 pts - tracks that are balanced with each other using volume and panning controls 
* 5 pts - Automation on at least on track
* 5 pts - dynamics processing on at least one track
* 5 pts - equalization on at least one track
* 5 pts - two examples of time-based effects, which can include delay, flanger, chorus, or reverb 
* 5 pts - an appropriate master level, between -6 dB and -3 dB, not clipping

Total - 30 pts
