## Project 1 - Starting the sample pack. 


Work in groups of 2-4 in the recording studio. One person “performs” while the other tracks, and anyone left ofter watches how to track. Pick one thing to record, an instrument or an object. 

Get at least 10 recordings of distinct sounds. If you're recording an instrument, don't just record 10 different tones. Try to get a variety of timbres. Try extended techniques. Experiment with placing the microphone different distances from the audio source. Also experiment with recording very quiet sounds, or very loud sounds. 

Remove unwanted material from the beginning and ending of the recording. Cut sounds into separate files and name them appropriately. Apply fades to the start and end to avoid clicks. Raise the levels of the recordings so they are all similar.

Make sure 5 of the recordings can be edited later as a loop. Explore all the different sounds that the object can make. Use at least two different microphones and compare the results.

Along with your recordings, be sure to turn in a list of what microphones you used for each recording, with a description of microphone placement.
