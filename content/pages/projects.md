## Project 1 - Starting the sample pack. 


Work in groups of 2-4 in the recording studio. One person “performs” while the other tracks, and anyone left over watches how to track. Pick one thing to record, an instrument or an object. 

Make at least 10 recordings. These will be used to build your own personal sample pack. Decide if you want these to be "musical" or "sound effects" recordings. If you decide to record something more musical, be sure to note the tempo and key of whatever you record, so that you can compose something more easily in the editing process. 

If you're going the sound effects route and recording an instrument, don't just record 10 different tones. Try to get a variety of timbres. Try extended techniques. Experiment with placing the microphone different distances from the audio source. Also experiment with recording very quiet sounds, or very loud sounds. 

Make sure 5 of the recordings can be edited later as a loop. Explore all the different sounds that the object can make. Use at least two different microphones and compare the results.

Along with your recordings, be sure to turn in a list of what microphones you used for each recording, with a description of microphone placement.

## Project 2

Create a 3 - 4 minute composition using your sample pack recordings. If you recorded musical sounds your composition might sound more traditionally music. If you recorded sound effects it will sound more like a soundscape or a piece of electroacoustic music. Either is good. Make use of the mixing concepts we've learned in class. 

A successful project will include: 
* 5 pts - tracks that are balanced with each other using volume and panning controls 
* 5 pts - Automation on at least on track
* 5 pts - dynamics processing on at least one track
* 5 pts - equalization on at least one track
* 5 pts - two examples of time-based effects, which can include delay, flanger, chorus, or reverb 
* 5 pts - an appropriate master level, between -6 dB and -3 dB, not clipping
* 5 pts - Form - Your composition should have an intro, middle section and an outro. 
* 5 pts - Write a paragraph about your composition and how it was created. Explain which sounds you used and why, and how you created the structure. In a few sentences, answer this question: Do you believe that creating music this way is a legitimate form of musical creativity? If so, why? If not, why not?

Total - 40 pts 

## Project 3 

## Project 4 

Ambient synth track in the style of Brian Eno 3 - 5 minutes. The work will have a bass, lead, and pad patch that you programmed yourself. Use the instructions from the past few lessons as starting places for your patches. Rename your patches to be descriptive of the sounds you are making and save your new presets. 

   Properties of ambient music: 
   1. Emphasis on atmosphere and texture 
   2. Gradual exploration of timbre 
   3. Simple harmonic progression 
   4. De-emphasis on melodies 

   Requirements:
   * 10 pts - Pad patch
   * 10 pts - Bass patch
   * 10 pts - Lead patch
   * 10 pts - Physical modeling synth



## Final project

Goals: 

* Students will develop their projects based on their own creative vision.
* Students will synthesize multiple techniques to realize their vision. 
* Students will begin to develop their own voices as artists.

Create a composition that you feel represents you as an artist. It should be 3 minutes or longer. You will use multiple techniques that we have learned through the semester to create your work. This should include: 

* Recording instruments in the studio 
* Sampling using those recordings
* Effects 
* Automation 
* MIDI Drums or percussion
* Synthesizers
   * Wavetable, Frequency Modulation, or Subtractive 

Each of these techniques don't need to be the focus of the project, but need to be used in some way. For example, if you record in the studio, you can then layer in MIDI drum sounds and synthesizers that double instruments you recorded. If you do most of the composing in the DAW, record some sounds in the studio to make your composition sound more realistic.

Rule on loops: You may use 1 or 2 loops as long as they are processed beyond recognition using effects or some other technique.

Feel free to compose in whatever style you like. Do you want to include a video? No problem. Want to record a rock song? Great. Want to create an original techno track? Perfect.

Each project will be presented to the class during the final exam time: **December 8th 10:30 AM - 12:30 PM.**

### Deliverables 

Turn in a **consolidated project file** along with a **rendered master track**. Also, turn in a **page long reflection** on your project. A section in the beginning should cover your influences for the work, who are you listening to in order to guide this composition? How is your work different from theirs? Next you should include the steps that you went through to create the project, the problems you ran into and the solutions you came up with. Finally, cover the any future work you plan to do with the project or new projects you might want to tackle with the skills you learned on this project. 

Grading: A successful project will show an understanding of the techniques we've learned throughout the semester and an application of those techniques towards a development of the students voice as an artist. Grading will also be based on the level of creativity and effort you put into your project.  

### Proposal 

**Due Thursday 11/18**

The final project proposal should be a short description outlining the following:

* what kinds of tools you’ll be using for the final project (software (Plugins?), hardware (audio interfaces, mics, synths?))
* what kinds of sounds you’ll be using (synthesized, recorded, instruments, voice?)
* what kind of composition you’ll be creating (ambient, electronic, etc.)
