title: "Bass Patch Lab"
---

The following steps are some suggestions for creating a usable bass patch. Once you’ve created the basic bass patch, you should experiment with the parameter settings to create a patch that is to your liking. You may want to sequence a short bass line for this instrument and set it to loop while you’re experimenting.
* Oscillators: use two oscillators, both set to sawtooth waves.
* Oscillators: detune one oscillator up 5 to 10 cents and detune the other down 5 to
10 cents.
* Filter: set the filter to be a low pass filter with resonance.
* Filter: set the cutoff frequency to the midpoint and the resonance to mid-to-high.
* Filter envelope: short attack, short decay, low-to-mid sustain, and no release (release
would also depend on the release value in the amplitude envelope); experiment
with the envelope amount.
* Amplitude envelope: short attack, short decay, medium sustain, and no release (to get
a plucked sound, set the sustain to 0 and control the duration with the decay control).
