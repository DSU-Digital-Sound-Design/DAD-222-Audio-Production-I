title: "Lead Patch Instructions"
---

The following steps are some suggestions for a usable lead patch. Once you’ve created the basic lead patch, you should experiment with the parameter settings to create a patch that is to your liking. You may want to sequence a short lead line for this instrument and set it to loop while you’re experimenting.
* Oscillators: use two oscillators with a different waveform for each; the combination should be a penetrating sound.
* Oscillators: set the polyphony to 1 and add a small amount of portamento so the patch slides a little bit between pitches (these settings may not be in the oscillator section).
* LFO/modulation routings: adjust the LFO amount and use it to modulate the oscillator(s) for vibrato; adjust the rate for a “natural” sounding vibrato—
you’ll use the mod wheel to add vibrato to sustained notes.
* Filter: set the filter to be a low pass filter with resonance.
* Filter: set the cutoff frequency to the midpoint and the resonance to mid-to-high.
* Filter envelope: short attack, short decay, low sustain, and no release (release would
also depend on the release value in the amplitude envelope); experiment with the
envelope amount.
* Amplitude envelope: short attack, short decay, mid-to-high sustain, and no release.
