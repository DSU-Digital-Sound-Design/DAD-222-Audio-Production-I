title: "Pad Patch Instructions" 
---

The following steps are some suggestions for a usable pad. Once you’ve created the basic pad, you should experiment with the parameter settings to create a patch that is to your liking. Because pads are generally lingering and wavering, there’s quite a bit of latitude here to create anything from a tasteful pad to a wild, demented one. You can do this patch with either Ableton's Analog or Operator devices. 
* Oscillators: use two or more oscillators with a different waveform for each; the combination should be an exotic “synthy” sound.
* Oscillators: detune the oscillators quite a bit from one another or set them to be a constant interval like a third or fifth apart.
* LFO/modulation routing: route the LFO to the oscillator(s) for vibrato; adjust the rate and amount/depth for a “natural” sounding vibrato—or use a slow rate with a modest amount/depth so that the pitch wavers slowly up and down during the note.
* Filter: set the filter to be a low pass filter with resonance.
* Filter: set the cutoff frequency to low-to-mid and the resonance to mid-to-high.
* Filter envelope: change the filter envelope to your liking 
<!-- • Modulation routing: route the mod wheel to the cutoff frequency of the filter—this
will allow you to control the evolution of the timbre over the length of the note. -->
*  Amplitude envelope: medium-to-long attack, no decay, maximum sustain, and medium-to-long release—this note will slowly rise to maximum and then slowly
release once you’ve released the key(s).
