 Part 1: 
   
Take your recordings from the studio and edit them in your DAW. If you haven't made your recordings yet find some from freesound to do the activity. Remove unwanted material from the beginning and ending of the recording. Cut sounds into separate files and name them appropriately. Apply fades to the start and end to avoid clicks. Raise the levels of the recordings so they are all similar. Export each file separately and submit to d2l. 

Part 2: 

Make a combination of all your edited recordings using crossfades. Export that file and name it Lastname_Crossfades.wav

Part 3: 

Re-edit your crossfade recording using warp markers, slowing and speeding up parts, pitching and stretching others. Export that file and name it Lastname_Warped.wav
