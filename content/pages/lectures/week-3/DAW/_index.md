In the days of reel-to-reel recording—the 1940s to the 1990s—transport controls literally caused tape to be transported from one reel to another. Though no physical material is being moved by the transport controls now, the label has stuck. 

Notice that these are the same as what show up on home audio products.

## Transport time

* real time
* SMPTE time - hours, minutes, seconds, and frames

In a project that is to be synchronized to video, such as sound effects editing, the clock will usually show SMPTE time. SMPTE time code divides a second into the number of frames at which the video was shot, which allows you to precisely synchronize elements of the project to the film. In a compositional project such as a song or a film score, the clock would usually show musical time in bars, beats, and divisions of a beat referred to as ticks, clicks, clocks, or units. This allows the audio to be integrated with MIDI-controlled software instruments.
