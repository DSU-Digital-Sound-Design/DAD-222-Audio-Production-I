Each time the ADC performs this measurement, it must assign a numerical value to that sample’s amplitude. This assignment of a specific value to the measured amplitude is referred to as quantizing. Don&rsquo;t get this quantizing confused with quantizing of MIDI data.</p><p>This is also known as bit depth, not to be confused with &ldquo;bit rate&rdquo;, which we will talk about at another time.</p><p>{{/note %}}</p></section><section><h2 id=bit-depths>Bit depths</h2><p><img src=bit-depth-chart.png alt></p><aside class=notes><p>16 bits is CD quality audio.</p><p>24 bits is common when recording.

Chunks of data written at the beginning of the file indicate information such as the sampling rate, the resolution, the number of channels (two for stereo, six for 5.1 surround, etc.), and the length of the file. Some formats include other information as well, such as loop points for use by hardware or software samplers. Digital audio that is used by audio editing/processing/mixing software is stored in an uncompressed file format.</p><p>{{/note %}}</p></section><section><h2 id=441-khz-16-bit-stereo>44.1 kHz, 16-bit, stereo</h2><p>44,100 samples/second × 2 bytes/sample = 88,200 bytes/second ≈ 90 kB/second</p><p>90 kB/second × 60 seconds/minute = 5,400 kB/minute ≈ 5 MB/minute</p><p>5 MB/minute × 2 channels (left and right) = 10 MB/minute</p></section><section><h2 id=compressed>Compressed</h2><ul><li>Lossless<ul><li>mp4</li><li>Ogg</li><li>Free Lossless Audio Codec - .flac</li></ul></li><li>Lossy<ul><li>mp3</li><li>mp4 with AAC</li></ul></li></ul><aside class=notes><p>Lossless compression reduces the size of audio files in such a way that the original data can be perfectly recovered.
